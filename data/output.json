An AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of \ndecision-making could include situations in which one or more of the following \nconditions are fulfilled. The first such condition should be that the AI system is intended \nto perform a narrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured \ndata into structured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into \ncategories or an AI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of \napplications. Those tasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only \nlimited risks which are not increased through the use of an AI system in a context that is \nlisted as a high-risk use in an annex to this Regulation. The second condition should be \nthat the task performed by the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously \ncompleted human activity that may be relevant for the purposes of the high-risk uses \nlisted in an annex to this Regulation. Considering those characteristics, the AI system \nprovides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered risk. \nThat condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve the \nlanguage used in previously drafted documents, for example in relation to professional \ntone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand messaging. \nEN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nThe third condition should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making \npatterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered \nbecause the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment \nwhich it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI \nsystems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can \nbe used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern \nso as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that \nthe AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment \nrelevant for the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, thus \nmaking the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing \na risk for the assessment to follow. That condition covers, inter alia, smart solutions for \nfile handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech \nprocessing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of \ninitial documents. In any case, AI systems used in high-risk use-cases listed in an annex \nto this Regulation should be considered to pose significant risks of harm to the health, \nsafety or fundamental rights if the AI system implies profiling within the meaning of \nArticle 4, point (4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 3, point (4) of Directive (EU) \n2016/680 or Article 3, point (5) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure traceability \nand transparency, a provider who considers that an AI system is not high-risk on the \nbasis of the conditions referred to above should draw up documentation of the \nassessment before that system is placed on the market or put into service and should \nprovide that documentation to national competent authorities upon request.

High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means \ncapabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-\npurpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood \nafter its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to \nthe state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative \namount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured \nin floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. \nThe cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used \nacross the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the \nmodel prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-\ntuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, \nif met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a \ngeneral-purpose AI model with systemic risks.

To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission \nto take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-\npurpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an \nimpact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken \non the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-\npurpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as \nquality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and \noutput modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. \nUpon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-\npurpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into \naccount and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be \nconsidered to present systemic risks.\nEN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\n",
