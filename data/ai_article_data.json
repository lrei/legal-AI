    "Summary": "The EU AI Act requires a risk management system for high-risk AI systems. This system should be a continuous process throughout the AI's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. It should identify and analyze potential risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights, estimate and evaluate these risks, and adopt measures to manage them. These measures should balance minimizing risks and fulfilling requirements. The system should also ensure that any remaining risk is acceptable and that measures are in place to eliminate or reduce risks as much as possible. High-risk AI systems should be tested to identify the best risk management measures and to ensure they work as intended. The system should also consider whether the AI could negatively impact people under 18 or other vulnerable groups.",

    "Text": "A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained in relation to high-risk AI systems."
