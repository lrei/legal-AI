    "Expected date": "July 2026 (July 2027 for Point 1)",
    "Summary": "This article outlines how to classify high-risk AI systems. An AI system is considered high-risk if it is used as a safety component of a product, or if it is a product itself that is covered by EU legislation. These systems must undergo a third-party assessment before they can be sold or used. Some AI systems are always considered high-risk, unless they don't pose a significant risk to people's health, safety, or rights. Providers who believe their AI system isn't high-risk must document their assessment before selling or using it. The EU Commission will provide guidelines and examples of high-risk and non-high-risk AI systems. They can also add or remove conditions for high-risk classification based on evidence. Any changes must not decrease the level of protection for health, safety, and rights.",
    "Paragraph": "1",
    "Text": "Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:"
