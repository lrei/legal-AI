These include AI systems that manipulate people's decisions or exploit their vulnerabilities, systems that evaluate or classify people based on their social behavior or personal traits, and systems that predict a person's risk of committing a crime. The Act also bans AI systems that scrape facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, infer emotions in the workplace or educational institutions, and categorize people based on their biometric data. However, some exceptions are made for law enforcement purposes, such as searching for missing persons or preventing terrorist attacks.",
    "Paragraph": "1",
    "Text": "1. The following AI practices shall be prohibited: (a) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm; (b) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behaviour of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm; (c) the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of AI systems for the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behaviour or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with the social score leading to either or both of the following: (i) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected; (ii) detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity; (d) the placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of an AI system for making risk assessments of natural persons in order to assess or predict the risk of a natural person committing a criminal offence, based solely on the profiling of a natural person or on assessing their personality traits and characteristics; this prohibition shall not apply to AI systems used to support the human assessment of the involvement of a person in a criminal activity, which is already based on objective and verifiable facts directly linked to a criminal activity; (e) the placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of AI systems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted scraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage; (f) the placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of AI systems to infer emotions of a natural person in the areas of workplace and education institutions, except where the use of the AI system is intended to be put in place or into the market for medical or safety reasons; (g) the placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or the use of biometric categorisation systems that categorise individually natural persons based on their biometric data to deduce or infer their race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation; this prohibition does not cover any labelling or filtering of lawfully acquired biometric datasets, such as images, based on biometric data or categorizing of biometric data in the area of law enforcement; (h) the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement, unless and in so far as such use is strictly necessary for one of the following objectives: (i) the targeted search for specific victims of abduction, trafficking in human beings or sexual exploitation of human beings, as well as the search for missing persons; (ii) the prevention of a specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of natural persons or a genuine and present or genuine and foreseeable threat of a terrorist attack; (iii) the localisation or identification of a person suspected of having committed a criminal offence, for the purpose of conducting a criminal investigation or prosecution or executing a criminal penalty for offences referred to in Annex II and punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years. Point (h) of the first subparagraph is without prejudice to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 for the processing of biometric data for purposes other than law enforcement."

    "Expected date": "July 2026",
    "Summary": "The EU AI Act requires a risk management system for high-risk AI systems. This system should be a continuous process throughout the AI's lifecycle, regularly reviewed and updated. It should identify and analyze potential risks to health, safety, or fundamental rights, estimate and evaluate these risks, and adopt measures to manage them. These measures should balance minimizing risks and fulfilling requirements. The system should also ensure that any remaining risk is acceptable and that measures are in place to eliminate or reduce risks as much as possible. High-risk AI systems should be tested to identify the best risk management measures and to ensure they work as intended. The system should also consider whether the AI could negatively impact people under 18 or other vulnerable groups.",

The Commission will work with relevant stakeholders to develop ways to measure these qualities. The accuracy of these AI systems should be declared in their instructions. These systems should be resilient to errors and faults, and should have backup plans in place. They should also be designed to reduce the risk of biased outputs. Finally, these systems should be secure against unauthorized third parties trying to exploit their vulnerabilities.",

    "Text": "4. High-risk AI systems shall be as resilient as possible regarding errors, faults or inconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system operates, in particular due to their interaction with natural persons or other systems. Technical and organisational measures shall be taken in this regard. The robustness of high-risk AI systems may be achieved through technical redundancy solutions, which may include backup or fail-safe plans. High-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into service shall be developed in such a way as to eliminate or reduce as far as possible the risk of possibly biased outputs influencing input for future operations (feedback loops), and as to ensure that any such feedback loops are duly addressed with appropriate mitigation measures."

These include using the systems as per instructions, assigning human oversight, ensuring input data is relevant, and monitoring the system's operation. If a risk is identified, the provider and relevant authorities must be informed immediately. Deployers must also keep logs generated by the AI system for at least six months. Before using a high-risk AI system, workers must be informed. If the system is not registered in the EU database, it should not be used. Deployers must also comply with data protection assessments and cooperate with relevant authorities.",

    "Expected date": "July 2026",
    "Summary": "Before using a high-risk AI system, public bodies and private entities providing public services must assess how the system could impact people's fundamental rights. This includes describing how and when the system will be used, who it might affect, and what risks it might pose. They also need to outline how humans will oversee the system and what steps will be taken if risks materialize. This assessment must be done for the first use of the system, but can be updated if necessary. The results must be reported to the market surveillance authority, unless exempt. The AI Office will provide a template to help with this process.",

Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in Article 6(2), with the exception of high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of Annex III, shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment consisting of: (a) a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose; (b) a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, each high-risk AI system is intended to be used; (c) the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the specific context; (d) the specific risks of harm likely to have an impact on the categories of natural persons or groups of persons identified pursuant to point (c) of this paragraph, taking into account the information given by the provider pursuant to Article 13; (e) a description of the implementation of human oversight measures, according to the instructions for use; (f) the measures to be taken in the case of the materialisation of those risks, including the arrangements for internal governance and complaint mechanisms."

    "Summary": "The EU is asking member states to support small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), including start-ups, in understanding and complying with new AI regulations. This includes giving these businesses priority access to AI regulatory sandboxes (safe spaces to test new AI technologies), providing training on the new rules, and offering advice through dedicated communication channels. The EU also wants to make it easier for these businesses to participate in the development of AI standards. The cost of assessing whether a business complies with the rules will be set according to its size and market size. The AI Office will provide templates, a single information platform, and communication campaigns to help businesses understand their obligations.",
    "Paragraph": "3",
    "Text": "3. The AI Office shall undertake the following actions: (a) provide standardised templates for areas covered by this Regulation, as specified by the Board in its request; (b) develop and maintain a single information platform providing easy to use information in relation to this Regulation for all operators across the Union; (c) organise appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness about the obligations arising from this Regulation; (d) evaluate and promote the convergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI systems."

    "Summary": "This article explains what happens if an AI system, which was classified as non-high-risk by its provider, is suspected to be high-risk by a market surveillance authority. The authority will evaluate the system and if it is indeed high-risk, the provider will be asked to make necessary changes to comply with regulations. If the system is used beyond the authority's national territory, other member states and the Commission will be informed. If the provider fails to comply within a given time, they may be fined. The provider must also take corrective action for all such systems in the market. If the system was intentionally misclassified to avoid regulations, the provider will be fined. The authorities can perform checks to monitor compliance.",
    "Paragraph": "8",
    "Text": "8. In exercising their power to monitor the application of this Article, and in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, market surveillance authorities may perform appropriate checks, taking into account in particular information stored in the EU database referred to in Article 71 of this Regulation."
